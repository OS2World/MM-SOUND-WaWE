Changing samplerate:
--------------------

The idea is the following:

Every channel contains X samples, at Y samplerate, which
means, that there should be Y samples sent out to the speaker in one second.

Showing it in an amplitude/time scale, it looks like this:


|              ***
|*            *   *
| *
|       **   *
|  *   *  ***
|   ***

       Figure 1.


Changing its samplerate means resampling, to hear almost the same if the
result is played back at Z samplerate.


How to do resampling?
---------------------

Let's say you have a series of samples as it's in Figure 1., and
that thing is sampled at Y samples per second, and you want to change its
samplerate to Z samples per second!

Let's imagine the current state as if the distance betwen the original samples
(the columns in Figure 1.) would be Z "units", so as much units as the new
samplerate is. Connect the samples with a line in your imagination.

(Now you should have an image in your mind, in which there is a figure similar
to Figure 1., but the '*'s are stretched horizontally, and connected with a 
line.)

Now, resampling it to Z means that you'll have to start from the very first 
sample, and step Y (!) units every time, and get the sample what you have 
there.

It will usually mean that you'll have to take two original samples, and 
calculate a third sample from those two, weighted, so that if it's closer to
the first sample, then it will be almost that sample, if it's closer to the
second sample, it will be almost the second sample (linear interpolation).



Easy, right? :)

2005.04.20: (v0.77)
 - added ~s to menu-items and added ACCELTABLE to WaWE-Resources.Rc to
   enhance keyboard-control for the progam.
   'm' now can be used instead of MB2 to get the context-menu of a window. (fbakan@gmx.net)
 - Changed IMPA plugin to check file more strictly. I hope it avoids now problems like 
   detecting WAV files as MP3 files.

2004.12.08.: (v0.76)
 - Moved all Clipboard functions under 'Edit' menu entry, and added 'Delete samples'
   capability to Clipboard plugin,
 - Saving a channel-set in a different format will automatically choose the correct
   Import plugin to reopen the channel-set.

   It only supports ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 TAGs yet.
 - Fixed bugs in InserSample and DeleteSample WaWEHelpers
 - Worker thread has been splitted into two worker threads. It means that one can
   use plugin functions while the screen is being redrawn.

   modify format-specific parameters of channel-sets
 - Implemented event callbacks
 - Fixed a crash that was caused by concurrent read access

   This plugin uses mpglib v0.2 internally, so it doesn't support free-format MP3 files. 
   Also, ID3 TAG support is limited to ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 only (yet).
 - Disabled MP3 support in IMMIO plugin now that there is a better one.
 - Fixed possible memory leak that could occur when an Import plugin says that it can
   handle a given file, and then later it cannot open it.
 - Last Import/Export folder is now saved in WaWE.cfg
 - Added WAV export plugin
